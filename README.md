### Conclusion

---

This analysis showed no inherent biases, as the percentage of 5-Star reviews were nearly identical whether they came from Paid or Unpaid reviewers. Prior to this analysis, I would have absolutely expected the reviews coming from Paid reviewers to be much more biased towards 5-Star ratings, but that was most certainly not the case. An interesting case study, indeed.
